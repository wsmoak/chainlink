## [Unreleased]

### Claude 4.6 Opus Optimization Epic (#99)

Comprehensive overhaul to make chainlink work seamlessly with Claude 4.6 Opus,
reducing tool-call overhead, improving machine-parseable output, and adding
context-compression resilience.

#### CLI Enhancements
- `chainlink quick` compound command — create + label + work in one call (#100)
- `--json` output flag on show command for structured machine-readable output (#101)
- `--quiet` / `-q` mode for minimal, pipe-friendly output (#108)
- `--work` and `--label` flags on `create` and `subissue` commands (#104)
- `close-all` batch command with label and priority filtering (#107)

#### Session & Context Management
- Stale session auto-detection and cleanup (auto-ends sessions idle >4 hours) (#102)
- Context compression breadcrumbs via `session action` — records last action, auto-comments on active issue, and restores context on resume (#111)
- PreToolUse hook nudges agent when no active working issue is set (#105)

#### Templates & Rules
- Three new AI-specific issue templates: `audit`, `continuation`, `investigation` (#110)
- Condensed behavioral guard mode — lighter rule injection after first prompt (#103)
- Reorganized rules into tiered priority system (critical/standard/optional) (#109)

#### Hooks
- Debounced linting mode in post-edit hook to reduce noise (#106)

#### Code Quality
- Fix all clippy warnings (introduced `CreateOpts` struct, removed dead imports, idiomatic Rust patterns) (#112)
- Database schema v7→v8 migration (adds `last_action` column to sessions, auto-applied on first use)

### Added
- Update READMEs with hook configuration documentation (#119)
- Split tracking instructions into per-mode markdown files (#118)
- Make issue tracking strictness configurable (#117)
- Make blocked git commands user-configurable in work-check hook (#116)
- Update all dependencies to latest versions (#114)
- Add comprehensive edge case testing (proptest, CLI fuzzing, Unicode E2E) (#50)
- Improve session management with auto-start and stronger rules (#48)
- Add sanitizing MCP server for safe web fetching (#47)
- Add macOS binary support to VSCode extension with cross-compilation (#32)
- Auto-create CHANGELOG.md if it doesn't exist when closing issues
- Automatic CHANGELOG.md updates when closing issues (based on labels)
- `--no-changelog` flag to skip changelog entry for internal work
- `chainlink export` now outputs to stdout by default, use `-o` for file output

### Fixed
- Fix vscode engine version to match @types/vscode (#115)
- Fix SQL injection vulnerability in milestone listing (#97)
- Fix cargo-mutants artifact left in production code (#97)
- Fix byte/char length mismatch for Unicode text truncation (#97)

## Project Goals

Chainlink is designed to be:
- **Simple**: No complex setup, just `chainlink init`
- **Lean**: Single binary, SQLite storage, no external dependencies
- **AI-First**: Built for AI-assisted development workflows
- **Context-Preserving**: Session handoff notes survive context resets
