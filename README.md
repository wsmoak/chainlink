# Chainlink

A simple, lean issue tracker CLI designed for AI-assisted development. Track tasks across sessions with context preservation.

## Features

- **Local-first**: All data stored in SQLite (`.chainlink/issues.db`)
- **Session management**: Preserve context across Claude/AI sessions with handoff notes
- **Dependencies**: Track blocking relationships between issues
- **Labels & priorities**: Organize issues with labels and priority levels
- **No sync complexity**: No git hooks, no auto-push, just simple local storage
